My code for project Euler problems. Most problems I solved with Python back in 2019. Now I am revisiting the problems to learn C++. Doing the same questions in C++ helps me to get a solid grip on efficient algorithms and data structures in this language.

## Caveat
Most of the problems I did while learning python in 2019, so at the time of writing (January 2025), that code is from quite some time ago! I therefore take no responsibility for dumb mistakes that are present in the python files that are in the initial dump.

## What is [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)?

>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
