> Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics.

My code for project Euler problems. Most problems I solved with Python back in 2019. Now (March 2025) I am revisiting the problems to learn C++. Doing the same questions in C++ helps me to get a solid grip on efficient algorithms and data structures in this language.

## A caveat
Most of the problems I did while learning python in 2019, so at the time of writing (March 2025), that code is from quite some time ago! I therefore take no responsibility for dumb mistakes that are present in the python folder :)

## What is [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)?

>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
